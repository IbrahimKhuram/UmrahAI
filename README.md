> Intelligent crowd management & navigation for Umrah pilgrims
---
> [!NOTE]
> Work In Progress Prototype [WIP]

## Abstract

With intelligent route recommendation for pilgrims within Masjid Al-Haram, inspired by Google Maps functionality, real-time crowd management insights for security personnel and decision-makers, and data-driven analysis to support future Masjid Al-Haram expansion planning. Sirat assists in streamlining the worship experience with reduced congestion, improving safety and security measures, and results in Cost-saving optimization of resources, with potential savings in the millions.

## Feature Overview
### Sirat takes into account of what pilgrims need to decide upon:
* **Category of prayer space:** men, women, and for the disabled. 
* **Overall conditions:** least crowded area, ground floor, shaded area, convenient time, etc
* **Specific requirement:** praying with view of Kaaba, proximity to ablution facilities, starting tawaf location, etc

### Leveraging AI for pigrims and service workers alike:
* **Interface for service workers** so Masjid guards can modify people's pathway and say, this is closed, go to this route, or another route based on real time pilgrim flow via location data.
* **AI stampede detection:** summon security if a crowd passing through a node is approaching dangerous levels.
